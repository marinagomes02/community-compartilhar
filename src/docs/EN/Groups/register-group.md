## Register your group

If you already have a **group registered on CPR** you can add it to our platform. This allows other users to see where existing groups are located, find ones in their region, and check if theyâ€™re looking for new members.
If you have a group but it's **not registered on CPR** yet, you can do it through this [link](https://www.acomunidade.org/tenho-grupo)

## Search for nearby users

If you are looking for other **users nearby**, who want to **form a sponsorship group**, you can do so in the [Groups](/groups) section.  
In this section, you can find all users within a radius of 70km who are looking for a group. To use this feature, make sure your **location pin** is marked on the map.

Users are listed starting with those closest to you at the top.
We display the approximate distance between your pins and provide direct links to their profiles. This way, you can easily contact and connect with them!
